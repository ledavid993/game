[2025-09-18T15:28:22] User instructions:
Implement the "Christmas Party Murder Game" plan within the `cms` Next.js/Payload CMS project. The complete plan lives in `cms/AGENTS.md` and details the game architecture, frontend routes, game logic, theming, and dependencies.

Repository root: /Users/davidle/Desktop/projects/MurdererHobo (git repo, app lives under cms/)

Key deliverables:
1. Tailwind CSS setup (tailwind.config.ts, postcss config, @tailwind base/components/utilities in globals) with @tailwindcss/forms and typography.
2. Frontend routes under cms/src/app/(frontend)/game (layout + landing page, host dashboard, player mobile views) using ThemeProvider, responsive design, animations, theme toggle.
3. API routes under cms/src/app/api/game (socket/start/kill/state) integrating Socket.IO, validating NEXT_PUBLIC_GAME_SECRET, and broadcasting updates.
4. Shared logic under cms/src/lib/game (GameManager singleton, types, socket helper) and cms/src/lib/themes (christmas + alternate theme definitions).
5. UI components under cms/src/components/game: HostDashboard, PlayerView, LiveFeed, ThemeToggle, ResponsiveWrapper, using Tailwind, framer-motion, zustand, react-hot-toast.
6. Update package.json dependencies (socket.io, socket.io-client, tailwindcss, @tailwindcss/forms, @tailwindcss/typography, framer-motion, zustand, react-hot-toast) and adjust scripts if needed.
7. Ensure environment variables NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_GAME_SECRET handled with defaults and documented in README.
8. Add vitest coverage for GameManager logic and update README with setup instructions for the game.

Goal: deliver a Christmas-themed murder mystery experience accessible via /game (landing/join), /game/host, and /game/play/[playerId], with real-time gameplay, theming, and documentation as outlined in the plan.

Files to consider: cms, cms/AGENTS.md

**Assessing implementation limits due to environment constraints**

I’m blocked from making any edits because the repo is mounted read-only and I can’t request write access (`approval_policy` is `never`). I can browse the plan or walk through how to implement it, but I’m unable to create the Tailwind setup, routes, sockets, or tests directly in this environment. Let me know if you’d like an outline or guidance you can apply locally once write access is available.
